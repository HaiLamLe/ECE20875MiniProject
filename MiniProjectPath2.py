# Path 2: Bike traffic
# The nyc_bicycle_counts_2016.csv gives information on bike traffic across a number of bridges in New York City.
# In this path, the analysis questions we would like you to answer are as follows:
#
# 1. You want to install sensors on the bridges to estimate overall traffic across all the bridges. But you only
# have enough budget to install sensors on three of the four bridges. Which bridges should you install the sensors
# on to get the best prediction of overall traffic?
#
# 2. The city administration is cracking down on helmet laws, and wants to deploy police officers on days with high
# traffic to hand out citations. Can they use the next day's weather forecast(low/high temperature and precipitation)
# to predict the total number of bicyclists that day?
#
# 3. Can you use this data to predict what day (Monday to Sunday) is today based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges?
#
# readme-nyc_bicycle_counts_2016.pdf details the information contained in the data field.


# Team: Hai Lam Le & Harini Subramanian
# To answer each of the questions above, we created and organized 3 files called problem1.py, problem2.py, problem3.py
